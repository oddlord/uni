    To the honourable IMT Institute, \par \bigskip
    
    I'm writing this letter to you as I would like to apply for the Computer Science and System
    Engineering (CSSE) PhD programme offered at IMT. \par \bigskip
    
    I've been studying Computer Science since I enrolled at the University of Florence back in 2009. Since then, I studied and followed this passion of mine without a pause, as I focused mainly in my academic career, but also on many other projects of various nature but always related to the vast world of Computer Science. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (Laurea Triennale in Informatica) back in 2012 and my Master's Degree in Computer Science (Laurea Magistrale in Informatica) recently, in April 2016, both with maximum marks and Magna Cum Laude. \par \bigskip
    
    But Computer Science is not my only passion. I also love to travel to new places, see and learn new things and, in general, work in international and innovative work places. Thanks to that I managed, in these last years, to reconcile these two passions of mine. For example, I studied one year abroad, in Madrid, through the Erasmus Programme, and later I worked one year at CERN, Geneva. I believe that through these experiences I managed to acquired many skills, like learning to communicate on a professional level in a foreign language or learning to live both professional and every day life in a completely new environment, not to mention all the new technologies and scientific notions I have learned and added to my ``cultural baggage''.\par \bigskip
    
    Sincerely, \par \medskip
    
    \qquad \qquad Tommaso Papini
