\section*{Research visits to external institutions}

  The followings are all the research visits done to external institutions:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \textbf{Destination:} Ageing Lab Foundation and University of Jaén, Jaén, Spain\\
      \textbf{Period:} May 20th - June 19th 2017\\
      \textbf{Research and results:} This period was part of an European secondment programme called REMIND and has been conducted while at the Ageing Lab Foundation \cite{ageinglab} and at the University of Jaén (\acused{UJA}\ac{UJA}), both in Jaén, Spain. The main goal was to explore and compare the different techniques for \ac{AAL} \ac{AR} and for the creation of datasets for \ac{AAL} \ac{AR} developed by the \acr{STLab} \cite{stlab} in Florence and by the Sinbad\textsuperscript{2} research group \cite{sinbad2} in Jaén. In particular, techniques for \ac{AAL} \ac{AR} based on stochastic models \cite{biagi2016stochastic,carnevali2015continuous} and on fuzzy logic \cite{medina2015activity}, as well as several works on the creation of datasets for \ac{AAL} \ac{AR} \cite{patara2015recommendations,quesada2015generation}, have been studied and compared and joint proposals have been suggested in order to take advantage of the different techniques studied. A final report has been produced on this work, containing a review of the studied methods as well as joint proposals taking advantage of the strong points of the methods shown.
