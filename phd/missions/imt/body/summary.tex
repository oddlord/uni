\section{Summary}

  \begin{frame}{Summary}
    We have proposed a compositional approach
    \begin{itemize}
      \item for analysis of assembly lines
      \begin{itemize}
        \item with transfer blocking and no buffer capacity
      \end{itemize}
      \item after inspection
      \begin{itemize}
        \item subject to discrete/continuous ambiguity
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{1em}
    Leveraging the positive correlation among remaining times
    \begin{itemize}
      \item we have derived stochastic bounds of performance measures
      \item with good and scalable results
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{1em}
    Future directions
    \begin{itemize}
      \item introduce buffer capacity
      \item derive additional performance measures
      \begin{itemize}
        \item e.g. time to complete the production of a certain product
        \item or of the next $N$ products
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
